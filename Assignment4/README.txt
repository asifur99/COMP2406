Before starting the server make sure to start up mongoose and mongod and then run node database-initializer to initiate some data in the database.
Then start node server.js and go to localhost 3000. Once you register you will be redirected to the users list but when accessing it you'll face 
a page where it'll take you to the login form again and there you have to enter the details for login. Once you enter the details you get access
to the profiles. Once we get to the profiles the ones that we can change the privacy for is our own account and it reloads itself once the privacy value is clicked.
During registration after you register you still have to go back to login page to sign in so that you can get access to the data. Tjay's about it as I struggled to complete the order directory.

Thank you very much have a blessed year!
